Every software engineer should know how to use git properly. Here's a list of
situations where I've found particular git commands to be useful.

#### Solution
`git blame`

#### Situation
When I'd like to see the history of the file for the following reasons:
1. Some lines of code don't make sense to me. I can find the pull request (PR) 
   that it links to and see if the PR or related issue contains more information 
   on why a particular solution was used. Alternatively, I'll find out which developer 
   wrote the code so that I can ask them directly.
2. I can see the history of the file and see why certain things were changed.
   Again, this is a powerful ability when one can look through the various 
   related PRs and understand why code is written the way it is in the 
   repository or repo for short.
   
#### Solution
`git push -f` - to force push the code to github instead of that push pull nonsense

#### Situation
TBC

#### Solution
`--interactive` - when rebasing through pycharm
  
#### Situation
- gives more control on which commits to drop. Can also adjust the commit message.
