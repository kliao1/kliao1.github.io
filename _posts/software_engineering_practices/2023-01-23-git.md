Every software engineer should know how to use git properly. Here's a list of
situations where I've found particular git commands to be useful.

#### Solution
`git blame`

#### Situation
When I'd like to see the history of the file for the following reasons:
1. Some lines of code don't make sense to me. I can find the PR that it links to
   and see if the PR or related issue contains more information on why this 
   particular solution was used. Alternatively, I'll find out which developer 
   wrote the code and I can ask them directly.
   
2. I can see the history of the file and see why certain things were changed.
   Again, this is a powerful ability when one can look through the various 
   related PRs and understand why code is written the way it is in the repo.
   
   
#### Solution
`git push -f` - to force push the code to github instead of that push pull nonsense

#### Situation
TODO

#### Solution
`--interactive` - when rebasing through pycharm
- gives more control on which commits to drop. Can also adjust the commit message.
