# Trackpad and Mouse Opposite Scrolling
## Problem
On a trackpad on the Macbook, we `scroll` down to move the page up when the 
trackpad `Scroll & Zoom` setting's Natural Scrolling option is enabled.

Keeping this enabled and connecting a mouse to the Macbook, a down `scroll` 
also moves the page up. However, the natural feel of a down `scroll` should 
move the page down.

I personally like the same motion on different devices to move the page differently:
- down on a trackpad should move the page up
- down on a mouse should move the page down

## Solution
To reverse the direction of only the mouse instead of the trackpad, 
use the following package on github:
