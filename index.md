Hi there!

## A bit about myself

### My Mindset
- I'm always thinking about how to make life easier on both a micro and macro scale.
- I chose engineering so that I would have the ability to build custom solutions.
- I believe everyone should have goals in their life and I've decided on home 
  automation and to improve project management as much of lives can be broken 
  down into a series of projects.

### My professional goals
- I'd like to develop my web development skills as well as know-how in the cloud
  computing space.
- Currently, I'm developing my skills in backend development using Python 
  (FastAPI) and PostgreSQL.
- In my spare time, I mock up super simple designs on Figma and tinker with 
  React JS to build them. I enjoy learning the end-to-end process of ideation to
  the final product (if we can ever call it that in software development).

### My hobbies
- I'm a pretty proficient player in badminton.
- I enjoy table tennis.
- I love hikes and taking rides on my bicycle.
- Currently, I'm working on a sort of add-on to Google Calendar to make 
  task management easier.

## Education

### Master of Engineering (Electrical) | The University of Melbourne  
- Feb 2020 - Dec 2021
- First Class Honours
- 

#### Capstone: The Development of the Autonomous Perception System on the MUR21 Autonomous Race Car
- I was the primary developer of the stereo vision system.
- 

#### CIE - Creating Innovative Engineering (ENGR90034)
- This project-based subject entailed working in groups of 5-6 Masters of Engineering
  students alongside MBA students. Each group was given an industry-based problem to 
  solve using human-centred design.
- My group was given the problem of `Determine the likelihood of using parts of 
  native forests as potential sources of biomass for the Barton Engine` from the
  startup, Capricorn Power, the developer of the Barton Engine.
- This subject taught me a lot about preparing for interviews with industry members
  such as DELWP, The Gippsland Council, Academic Professors, and so on. I also
  learned to summarise our findings to simple, succinct extracts that can quickly
  convey the main points to all stakeholders.
  
#### LFI - Leadership for Innovation (ENGR90036)
- This is also a project-based subject that is a sequel to CIE. In this subject,
  I was a project mentor where I guided the group of 5-6 students in solving
  their industry-based problems.
- The crux of this subject is to teach enable students to deeply reflect on the
  different types of leadership and how to leverage each type to guide the team
  that they've been given/assembled.
- I found the lessons from this subject particularly helpful in identifying my 
  personal traits such as having a tendency to avoid confrontation. I also learned
  to be more accepting of others' feedback due to the understanding that it is
  not a personal attack on myself.
- These lessons greatly help in all aspects of my life as I can use them to 
  continuously improve my character to get along well and be more productive with
  the members of our community.

### Bachelor of Science (Electrical Systems) - The University of Melbourne
