Hi there! So, A bit about myself!

### My Mindset
- I'm always thinking about how to make life easier on both a micro and macro scale.
- I chose engineering so that I would have the ability to build custom solutions.
- I believe everyone should have goals in their life and I've decided on home 
  automation and to improve project management as much of our lives can be broken 
  down into a series of projects.

### My professional goals
- I'd like to develop my web development skills as well as know-how in the cloud
  computing space.
- Currently, I'm developing my skills in backend development using Python 
  (FastAPI) and PostgreSQL.
- In my spare time, I mock up super simple designs on Figma and tinker with 
  React JS to build them. I enjoy learning the end-to-end process of ideation to
  the final product (if we can ever call it that in software development).

### My hobbies
- I'm a pretty proficient player in badminton.
- I enjoy table tennis.
- I love hikes and taking rides on my bicycle.
- Currently, I'm working on a sort of add-on to Google Calendar to make 
  task management easier.

## Professional Experience

### Electrical and Software Engineer | Orkestra Technologies Pty Ltd
- Jan 2022 - Present
- Design, implement, and test new features in our optimisation software 
  simulating power flow among batteries, solar panels, loads, the grid, and so on.
- Liaise with key stakeholders such as battery manufacturers to understand the 
  latest battery modelling techniques and designed the battery degradation 
  modelling, standby losses, and minimum state of charge of a battery feature
  within the Orkestra optimization software.
- Conduct research e.g., tariffs, LGCs, and STCs on the energy market.
- Develop back-end components to add more functionality to Orkestra Plan, to 
  improve responsiveness and to boost performance.
- Implement security and data protection solutions.
- Coordinate with the front-end team and product owner to understand design 
  requirements and provide technical solutions.

### O-Lab Team Member | Swan Foresight Pty Ltd | Opportunity Lab | The University of Melbourne
- Dec 2021 - Feb 2022
- Designed and prototyped an encryption algorithm on a development board with 
  similar specifications to a solar inverter’s onboard microcontroller.
- The encryption algorithm’s performance was tested for computational time,
  memory, and power consumption.
- Data from the solar inverter was published to an AWS pipeline that is 
  ultimately displayed on a dashboard.

## Education

### Master of Engineering (Electrical) | The University of Melbourne (2020 - 2021)
- First Class Honours

### Bachelor of Science (Electrical Systems) - The University of Melbourne (2017 - 2019)
- First Class Honours
  
#### Awards & Distinctions
- Melbourne School of Engineering Scholarship
- Leaders in Communities Award
- Melbourne School of Engineering Ambassador Leadership Program
- Science Student Ambassador Leadership Program
- Endeavour Student Ambassador Program

#### Capstone: The Development of the Autonomous Perception System on the MUR21 Autonomous Race Car
- Employed agile principles to design and build the stereo camera pipeline, 
  utilizing Basler cameras in the autonomous race car for the Melbourne 
  University Racing student club over 12 months.
- The perception system runs on the Jetson AGX Xavier which uses Ubuntu 18.04 
  and ROS as the middleware to manage raw sensor data.
- Designed and robustly tested the stereo vision pipeline which uses 
  state-of-the-art object detection (YOLOv4) written in C++ and OpenCV, key point 
  regression, and feature extraction (SIFT) to obtain the 3D pose estimation 
  of the traffic cones that marks the racetrack.
- Experienced in using shell commands and has a good knowledge of Linux.
- Experimented with various camera settings that could be adjusted in software 
  to account for varying weather conditions which is important for race conditions.
- Integrated with the MUR 2019E race car and the Husky robot for testing.
- Developed complex problem-solving skills through designing various experiments and
  troubleshooting procedures to determine faults in the embedded systems.

#### CIE - Creating Innovative Engineering (ENGR90034)
- This project-based subject entailed working in groups of 5-6 Masters of Engineering
  students alongside MBA students. Each group was given an industry-based problem to 
  solve using human-centred design.
- My group was given the problem of `Determine the likelihood of using parts of 
  native forests as potential sources of biomass for the Barton Engine` from the
  startup, Capricorn Power, the developer of the Barton Engine.
- This subject taught me a lot about preparing for interviews with industry members
  such as DELWP, The Gippsland Council, Academic Professors, and so on. I also
  learned to summarise our findings to simple, succinct extracts that can quickly
  convey the main points to all stakeholders.
  
#### LFI - Leadership for Innovation (ENGR90036)
- This is also a project-based subject that is a sequel to CIE. In this subject,
  I was a project mentor where I guided the group of 5-6 students in solving
  their industry-based problems.
- The crux of this subject is to teach enable students to deeply reflect on the
  different types of leadership and how to leverage each type to guide the team
  that they've been given/assembled.
- I found the lessons from this subject particularly helpful in identifying my 
  personal traits such as having a tendency to avoid confrontation. I also learned
  to be more accepting of others' feedback due to the understanding that it is
  not a personal attack on myself.
- These lessons greatly help in all aspects of my life as I can use them to 
  continuously improve my character to get along well and be more productive with
  the members of our community.
